# CMake toolchain file that uses Keil Arm Compiler 6 (armclang) for C
# compilation, while assembling and linking with the GNU arm-none-eabi tools.
#
# armclang is the LLVM/clang-based compiler shipped with Keil MDK
# (D:/Keil_v5/ARM/ARMCLANG/bin). We still link with GNU ld so the existing
# linker script (stm32u575zi.ld), newlib-based syscalls.c and the ST startup
# file all keep working, and probe-rs/OpenOCD flashing stays identical.
